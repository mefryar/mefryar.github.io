Hi! I'm Michael. I'm a software engineer with a background in economics and
international development.  I try to have a [growth
mindset](https://hbr.org/2016/01/what-having-a-growth-mindset-actually-means).
I love learning and sharing what I learn, which is the goal of this site.

I'm currently working to improve financial services for traditionally
underserved individuals as a part of [Juntos](https://juntosglobal.com/about/).
I was previously a Research Fellow with [Evidence for Policy
Design](https://epod.cid.harvard.edu/) at Harvard Kennedy School, working to
help policymakers use data and evidence for decision making.
