Hi! I'm Michael. I'm a software engineer with a background in economics and
international development.  I try to have a [growth
mindset](https://hbr.org/2016/01/what-having-a-growth-mindset-actually-means).
I love learning and sharing what I learn, which is the goal of this site.

I'm currently working to design financial services that help people become the
best versions of themselves as a part of
[Nubank](https://nubank.com.br/en/careers/). This work began at Juntos, which
was [acquired by
Nubank](https://labsnews.com/en/news/business/nubank-buys-american-juntos-global-for-personalized-chats-with-customers/).
Prior to that, I was a Research Fellow at [Evidence for Policy
Design](https://epod.cid.harvard.edu/) at Harvard Kennedy School, where I worked
to help policymakers use data and evidence for decision making.
