# When Jekyll builds, each import statement is replaced with the contents of the
# stylesheet with the same name in the _sass directory, and the combined 
# stylesheets are transformed into CSS as _site/styles.css.
# Adding a comment ensures Jekyll reads the file to be transformed into CSS later.
# Only main files, those not prefixed with an underscore, contain this front matter.
